\section{Delta Correlation Prediction Table}
The first implementation of DCPT was not right according to the pseudocode in \cite{dcptpaper}, but it accomplish a 8.6\% speedup with a table of 100 entries and 10 delta per entry.
The attempts to tweak this with other values have not been successful, but it gives around 8\% speedup.
Attempts to add a check to issue less prefetches does also lead to less speedup.

The next implementation, which should be right according to the pseudocode in \cite{dcptpaper} did not do as well, a maximum of 7.3\% speedup with the same specification as the first implementation was accomplished.
