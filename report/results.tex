\section{Delta Correlation Prediction Table}
This implementation get a 8.6\% speedup with a table of 100 entries and 10 delta per entry.

The attempts to tweak this with other values have not been successful, but it gives around 8\% speedup.

Attempts to add a check to issue less prefetches does also lead to less speedup.
